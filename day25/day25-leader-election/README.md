# Day 25: Leader Election Implementation

## Overview
Implements Raft consensus algorithm for leader election in distributed log storage cluster.

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run demo
python demo.py

# View web interface
open web/index.html
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Start cluster
docker-compose up --build

# View web demo
open http://localhost:8080
```

## Architecture

- **RaftNode**: Core Raft implementation with leader election
- **ClusterManager**: Manages multiple nodes and cluster operations  
- **Web Interface**: Interactive visualization of election process

## Key Features

- ✅ Leader election with majority consensus
- ✅ Automatic failover and recovery
- ✅ Election timeout randomization
- ✅ Term-based conflict resolution
- ✅ Interactive web demo

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Election**: Single leader elected
2. **Leader Failure**: Automatic re-election
3. **Network Partition**: Graceful handling
4. **Concurrent Elections**: Conflict resolution

## Next Steps

Tomorrow: Implement health checking and cluster membership management
